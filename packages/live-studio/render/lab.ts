// What a page run by render.mjs talks to: the studio's own render page, or a film's lab page (ENTRY=lab/x.ts), which imports
// this as "live-studio/lab". The page runs in a headless Chrome; everything it says comes back to the terminal.
export const post = (url, body) => fetch(url, { method: "POST", body });
// lines go out one after another, so the terminal prints them in the order the page logged them

// A page that throws ends the run with the error, instead of leaving it to wait out its time limit

window.onunhandledrejection = (e) => { log("ERROR " + (e.reason?.stack ?? e.reason)); };

// Written as renders/NAME
export const still = async (name, from, quality = 0.92) => post(`/still/${name}`, await new Promise((res) => from.toBlob(res, "image/jpeg", quality)));
// Ends the run; chunks: how many clip chunks the film has, so render.mjs joins exactly those
